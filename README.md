# SGGestureRecognizer

SGGestureRecognizer is a graphics gesture recognizer based on Dollar One Alghrithm for iOS. It's more powerful than the UIGestureRecognizeer, it can record any gesture graphic at one stroke, suck as a star, an rectangle and so on. You can use these graphics to execute specific action.
